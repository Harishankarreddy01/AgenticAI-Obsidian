# Semantic Search in RAG

Semantic search improves RAG by retrieving **relevant, meaning-based content** instead of just keyword matches. It helps the LLM get better grounding from external data.

---

## What Is Semantic Search?

Instead of looking for exact words, semantic search understands the **meaning of the query** and matches it to conceptually similar chunks in your documents.

---

## Why Semantic Search Matters in RAG

### 1. More Accurate Retrieval

> Example:  
> Query: “How much was spent on machinery repairs last year?”  
> ❌ Keyword search → returns many docs with “machinery” and “repairs”  
> ✅ Semantic search → finds:  
> *“In 2023, $24,500 was spent on equipment maintenance.”*

This ensures the LLM receives **clean, relevant context** to work with.

### 2. Reduces Hallucinations

When the LLM gets high-quality, semantically matched chunks, it doesn’t need to guess — reducing made-up answers.

---

### 3. Understands Synonyms & Intent

Semantic search links concepts even if the wording is different:  
“Power consumption” → “Battery drain”  
“Hiring policy” → “New employee guide”

---

## Summary

Semantic search is a key part of RAG. It:

- Brings **highly relevant** data to the LLM
- Reduces noise and hallucination
- Makes RAG smarter, faster, and more useful
