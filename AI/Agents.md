**An Agent does four key things:**
- **See:** They look at what you’re asking.
- **Think:** They carefully decide what to do first.
- **Remember:** They keep track of useful things they learned before.
- **Do:** They can choose to take actions, like checking prices or offering special deals.

### **Example of Agent behavior:**

- You ask again, “How much for two bags?”
- This time, your agent friend thinks:
    - “Hmm, I know the price, but maybe I can sell more and make extra money.”
        
    - It then says: “Hey, instead of two bags for $12, how about three bags for $15?”
        
    
- This extra step (thinking and choosing what action to take) makes it smarter and more helpful for business.
