**First, what’s a Large Language Model (LLM)?**
- Imagine you have a super-smart friend who has read almost everything on the internet.
- If you ask your friend a question like “How much for two bags?”, your friend guesses what you’re likely talking about based on all they’ve read.
- This friend (the LLM) just guesses the best possible next word based on everything learned from the internet.
- But it doesn’t really “think,” it just makes smart guesses based on its huge memory of internet text.
