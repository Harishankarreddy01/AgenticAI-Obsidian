### **What does “Multi-Agent” mean?**

Multi-agent means the agent knows its own limits clearly and when it can’t handle something itself, it asks another agent (or even a human) for help.

### **Simple example from the teacher:**

- You ask: “Can you give me a discount to NYC?”
    
- The agent thinks carefully:
    
    - “I don’t have the authority to give discounts.”
        
    
- Instead of saying “No,” the agent says:
	“**Let me ask my manager agent for you.**”

Another example implied:

- You ask something too complex.
    
- The agent recognizes clearly:
    
    - “This is difficult for me alone.”
        
    
- It replies:
    
    “**I’ll ask a librarian to help answer your question.**”
    

### **Why does Multi-Agent matter?**

Multi-agent behavior shows the agent is wise, practical, and humble. It knows when to ask for help, improving quality and trust.
