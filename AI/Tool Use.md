### **What does “Tool Use” mean?**

Tool use is when an agent realizes its own knowledge isn’t enough, so it uses other tools (like a calculator, search engines, or databases) to give a better answer.


### **Simple example from the teacher:**

- You ask: “What’s the airfare from LA to NYC?”
    
- The simple LLM just guesses “$500” based on past internet reading.
    
- But a smart agent thinks:
    
    - “Hmm, I shouldn’t guess. Let me call the airline.”
        
    
- It then responds:
    
    “**I’ll call the airline to check the airfare.**”
    

  

Another example:

- You ask: “What’s the airfare for my family of 5?”
    
- Instead of guessing (500 x 5 = $2500), the agent realizes it might make a math mistake, and thinks:
    
    - “I better use a calculator app.”
        
    
- It uses the calculator and gives you an accurate, confident response.
    


### **Why does tool use matter?**

  

Tool use makes the agent smarter, more accurate, and trustworthy, because it’s not guessing—it’s using actual data and correct calculations.
