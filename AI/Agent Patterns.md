## **What Exactly is an “Agent Pattern”?**


An agent pattern is a special kind of **behavior** that helps you know you’re dealing with an **AI Agent** rather than just a simple Large Language Model (LLM). Think of it like “habits” or “traits”—if a piece of software has these traits, it’s probably an **Agent**.

 Four important patterns:
1. **[[Reflection]]**
    
2.  [[Tool Use]]
    
3. **[[Planning]]**
    
4. **[[Multi-Agent]]**

## **Why does understanding these patterns matter deeply?**

Understanding these patterns helps you clearly recognize when an AI is truly “smart” and behaving like a helpful, intelligent human. These patterns mean an AI agent:

- **Stops to think carefully (Reflection)**
    
- **Uses tools for accuracy (Tool use)**
    
- **Plans clearly step-by-step (Planning)**
    
- **Knows when to ask for help (Multi-Agent)**
